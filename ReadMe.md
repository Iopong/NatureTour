## About
* The main basis of this project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of 
float layout by building a tourist site called Natours. 

* The main project idea comes from an Advanced CSS course I took on Udemy by
[Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)

* The project is written in sass. 

## Running the project
